# Automated Email Notification System

I recently developed and deployed an **automated email notification system** using [n8n](https://n8n.io/). This system is designed to send timely updates to users **every 5 minutes**, ensuring consistent engagement and communication.

## Features
- **Automated Updates:** Emails are sent at regular 5-minute intervals without manual intervention.
- **Workflow Automation:** Leveraging n8n workflows to streamline processes and reduce manual effort.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Improved consistency and efficiency in user communication.

## Tech Stack
- **Workflow Automation:** n8n
- **Email Delivery:** (Specify your email service, e.g., SMTP, SendGrid)
- **Scheduling:** 5-minute interval automated triggers

## Benefits
- Ensures timely communication with users
- Reduces manual workload and potential errors
- Enhances engagement and reliability of notifications
